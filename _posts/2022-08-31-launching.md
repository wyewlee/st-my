*insert merdeka 65 years*

It has been 62 years since the *1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons 1954* came into effect, where 96 state parties came into affirmation to protect stateless individuals. Followed by the recent ascension of the Philippines to *1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness* and the election of Malaysia to the *UN Human Rights Council*, we have seen no major will by The Government of Malaysia to address the issue of statelessness. 

Frustrated with the plight of statelessness in Malaysia, ***Stateless.my*** is being launched to platform and document the stories of the stateless community. Stateless.my aims to increase the discord of the statelessness issue among Malaysians.

Stateless.my is launched by Wong Yew Lee, a concerned youth affected by statelessness in Malaysia, he believes that citizenship should not be exclusively proven via papers. 

#### What Is The Direction Of Stateless.my?

*We would like to invite every concerned Malaysian to join the struggle of stateless Malaysians.*
*collective of people*
*people based*
*everyone*
*affirm human rights value and intersectionality*

#### Documenting The Stories Of Statelessness

For too long, the voices of the stateless community have been unheard. Marginalised and unplatformed, Stateless.my aims to document the stories of statelessness through our platform. 

Stateless.my acknowledge the difficult yet unique journey of every stateless Malaysian in finding the exit for statelessness. Everyone has a very unique story to share.
