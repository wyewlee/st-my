#### Joint Statement: Madani Government Must Abandon Regressive Citizenship Amendments

#### Madani government must abandon regressive citizenship amendments

The Malaysian Citizenship Rights Alliance (MCRA), The Child Rights protection group and Impacted Malaysian parents urges PM Anwar’s Madani Government to promptly abandon the proposed regressive citizenship amendments which will further impact categories of children who are constitutionally Malaysian and who have been arbitrarily and wilfully denied citizenship by KDN. These amendments aim to legitimise KDN’s unconstitutional actions which do not have the mandate of the rakyat. 

Further, these regressive amendments are being made without engaging with and seeking input from organisations working on the ground with impacted individuals and communities; and are being proposed without understanding the issues or collecting relevant information and data. Changing citizenship laws, which grant children access to other fundamental constitutional and human rights, based on whimsical or discriminatory motives will lead to unjust consequences and place more innocent children at risk of harm and violation. Any amendments to the criteria for acquiring citizenship should only be done after thorough data gathering, research, examination of comparative laws and exploring alternative solutions to existing issues. It is deeply worrying that this Madani government is approaching such crucial and fundamental legislation in an arbitrary, cavalier and negligent manner with complete disregard for  the categories of children who will suffer as a consequence of these draconian amendments.

We are alarmed at Deputy Home Minister Datuk Seri Dr Shamsul Anuar Nasarah’s comment that the  government's proposal to abrogate section 1(e) and section 2(3) in Part II of the Second Schedule “was aimed at preventing the misuse of obtaining citizenship”, such as by ‘illegitimate’ children who claim that they do not have any citizenship at birth. This statement was made despite acknowledging that these sections “fundamentally protect any person from becoming stateless”. The Deputy Minister’s lack of awareness and knowledge of these issues is both astounding and embarrassing, and indicative of the lack of informed decision-making that is taking place about this critical constitutional issue. In all the cases filed before the Malaysian  court under section 1(e), the affected children have been able to prove that they are not  citizens of any other country, whilst the government has failed to prove otherwise, despite having access to  inter-governmental (G2G) communication and exchange of data and information. To abrogate the fundamental rights of vulnerable children because the government has been derelict in its responsibilities is cruel and inhumane.

We find the Deputy Minister’s rationale wholly unacceptable and particularly discriminatory against children born out of wedlock, and a clear abrogation of their responsibility and obligation to act in the best interest of children, and to ensure their protection and their right to life with dignity. 

We further make reference to the response given by the KDN Deputy Minister that CSOs and several other stakeholders were merely given a briefing on the proposed amendments in June . We remind the Deputy Minister that we were left with many unanswered questions and any requests for data or information in support of amendments have not yet been provided. In addition, repeated requests to meet with the Minister of Home Affairs, Saifuddin Nasution, have been ignored. This raises concerns about the preparedness and assessment by KDN on the potential impact and harm these amendments may cause, particularly by leaving children who are Malaysian, and not citizens of any other country, without any avenues to pursue their claims for citizenship through judicial or administrative means.

During the briefing, CSOs had also pointed out that KDN’s understanding of the laws of the countries mentioned in the comparative study is grossly erroneous, as all the mentioned countries (i.e. United Kingdom, Singapore and Japan) do not discriminate against children born out of wedlock to their citizens. These countries also provide automatic citizenship for foundling children. 

Citizenship laws play a crucial role in defining the legal status and rights of individuals within a nation, and their contributions towards development. Any changes to these laws should be made with careful consideration, reflecting a commitment to principles of justice, equality, and the protection of individual human and other rights. Addressing statelessness is not only a matter of human rights but also crucial for sustainable development. Efforts to prevent and reduce statelessness should involve legal reforms to prevent statelessness, identify and resolve existing situations of statelessness to ensure that all individuals can fully participate in the social, economic, and political aspects of their communities. Being ignorant about  the stateless population among Malaysian children, can only lead to multigenerational instability.
