#### Joint Statement:Halt regressive amendments; proceed with amendments granting Malaysian mothers equal citizenship rights 

9 October 2024 - We, civil society organisations (CSOs), activists, subject experts and impacted individuals, express our grave concern over the upcoming Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2024 – specifically the provisions  relating to citizenship – that is set to be debated in Parliament. With just four days remaining before the Dewan Rakyat meeting begins, we have yet to receive any updates or refinements to the Bill as announced by the Home Minister in July 2024. This lack of transparency and communication is deeply troubling and contrary to the Madani government’s promise of a more inclusive and transparent democracy.

We have previously highlighted that the Bill, in its current form, contains critical flaws that, if not addressed, will have far-reaching consequences for vulnerable communities across Malaysia, not least the indigenous communities of Sabah, Sarawak and Peninsular Malaysia. The Minister must transparently disclose full details of how he intends to address these critical flaws, including the exact refinements to the Bill or any regulations to the Bill, and give all stakeholders sufficient time to study the Ministry’s proposed amendments. The bill should not move forward in its current form, as it combines several regressive amendments with a positive amendment addressing the rights of Malaysian mothers.

While the Bill contains a positive provision—allowing Malaysian mothers to automatically confer citizenship to their children born overseas—this is the only progressive amendment. However, this amendment does not have retroactive application, which means that current overseas-born children (including those over 21 years) of Malaysian mothers will continue to be discriminated against as they will still not have an automatic right to citizenship.

The Bill also includes 3 regressive constitutional amendments that will negatively impact the children of permanent residents (PR); citizenship applications of stateless children above the age of 18; and foreign spouses to Malaysian men.

To address the potential increase in statelessness caused by these amendments, we call for safeguards to be introduced in the Bill so that Constitutional guarantees which have existed since the formation of the Federation are not eroded. 

We remind MPs that although points raised during parliamentary debates are recorded in the Hansard, they do not bind ministers or the government to specific policies or laws. Therefore, it is crucial that all safeguards are explicitly included in the Bill itself, ensuring no ambiguity or risk of future misinterpretation. 

We note from  SUHAKAM's press statement that its views on the proposed amendments also seem to have been disregarded. The suggestion that even SUHAKAM’s concerns may have been discounted by this government is alarming, especially when the Ministry appears to have given assurances to the Council of Rulers that it would fine-tune the Bill with SUHAKAM.

This government must act in the best interests of its people. In so doing, this government must not assume that only it knows best. On matters involving fundamental rights and freedoms, all stakeholders must be meaningfully consulted. We call on the Home Minister to withdraw the amendments related to the denial of automatic citizenship to children of Malaysian permanent residents (section 1(a)) and ensure that the amendment for Malaysian mothers is made retroactive. Additionally, necessary safeguards must be included to protect those at risk of statelessness due to these constitutional changes.

All Ministers and MPs have been given copies of a matrix prepared by CSOs in consultation and collaboration with academics, legal experts and representatives from the different States, including Sabah and Sarawak, which provides a middle ground to address the government’s stated concerns on national security issues, while safeguarding the citizenship rights of those whose rights risk being abused by successive governments.

In light of the urgency and complexity of this issue, should the Bill continue to be tabled, we request that the government decouple the Bill and vote on its provisions in parts, ensuring that each section is thoroughly scrutinised. All safeguards should be fully discussed and risks presented transparently before any debate in Parliament takes place.
