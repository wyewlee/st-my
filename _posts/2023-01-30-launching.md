It has been 69 years since the *1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons 1954* came into effect, where 96 state parties came into affirmation to protect stateless individuals. Followed by the recent ascension of the Philippines to *1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness* and the election of Malaysia to the *UN Human Rights Council*, we have seen no major will by The Government of Malaysia to address the issue of statelessness. 

In this post-GE15, We can see a slight will shown by The Unity Government to address the statelessness. However, the fight and struggle should be carried on, until statelessness is truely eradicated. 

Frustrated with the plight of statelessness in Malaysia, ***Stateless.my*** is being launched to platform and document the stories of the stateless community. Stateless.my aims to increase the discord of the statelessness issue among Malaysians.

Stateless.my is launched by Wong Yew Lee, a concerned youth affected by statelessness in Malaysia, he believes that citizenship should not be exclusively proven via papers.
